"""
This class is derived from my older code and has been modified to suit this assignment.

Essentially, this class is designed to handle the sending/receiving/listening portion
of messaging over sockets. It can act as both a server (receiver) or a client (sender)
and is mainly used to simplify the logic of using messages and make made code look neater.
If run as a server (which is the default) it will call the function got_message() in the
class that created it whenever a message is received.
When creating an instance of this class, the callback generally should be set to "self" eg:
socket_manager = SocketManager(self, port=int(port))
